What is this `local_configs` directory?
=======================================

The contents of this folder (other than this README.md, which was forcefully
added to git) are ignored by git. The idea is that config files present here
are only for the current local machine. For example, a work machine with local
work files present.

Unless files are added to git with `--force`, nothing in here should be tracked.
