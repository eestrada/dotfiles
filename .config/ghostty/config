# vim: set filetype=voll:

# Ghostty's config syntax is very similar to VOLL.
# The only real difference is that keys are more freeform in Ghostty.
# For example, keys can contain dashes.
# Thus, this format can just be set to voll for the time being.
# See Syntax docs here: https://ghostty.org/docs/config#syntax
